            <p>This is a stationary VR shooter prototype that I worked on over the summer of 2021. It is my first time
                using Unity’s XR interaction toolkit and was developed with the Valve index controllers in mind. It
                involves the player shooting at enemies with multiple different guns.

            <p> I have made a devlog to record the first few weeks of development, but unfortunately, this project has
                been put on hold as I decided to focus on Two Sides.

                A lot of emphasis was put on the weapon reload to make them satisfying, as it allows the player to
                interact and operate with it, which plays towards the strength of VR.

                            <p>The first weapon in the game is a very straightforward semi-auto weapon. Pulling out and
                                replacing the blue battery to reload. The colour of the battery indicates the energy/
                                ammo left in it. The player will need to cock the weapon by pulling the back if they are
                                reloading from empty.</p>

                            <p>The weapon operates by controlling a mechanical arm, the arm moves using unity’s IK
                                system. Use the controller to move and point the weapon around. The weapon will be in
                                minigun mode when holding the controller vertically, it shots projectile full auto at a
                                high rate. Holding the controller horizontally transforms the weapon into a grenade
                                launcher that shoots slow travelling bouncing grenades that do slash damage in an area.
                                The grenade explodes after a set time, bounce or on direct impact at an enemy.</p>

                            <p>A small fully auto weapon that shoots at a high rate but with a high bullet spread. This
                                weapon’s looks are inspired by Halo’s Needler and Destiny’s Vex Mythoclast (totally
                                wasn’t because I can get it to drop in-game). Its speciality is that it can be partially
                                loaded and still shoot with at least one battery loaded, 3 batteries maximum. It also
                                has a very satisfying reload with the empty batteries automatically getting ejected and
                                popping out.</p>

                            <p>
                                This is the last weapon added in the game. It is a shotgun that is inspired by clay
                                shooting shotguns, its speciality is that it can turn into a crossbow with a press of a
                                button. In shotgun form, it shots a spread of projectiles and can be reloaded by
                                dragging the barrel downwards and letting the player swap the batteries out. Empty
                                batteries will be automatically ejected as well. In crossbow form, it can lock on to the
                                target the player is pointed at and shots an arrow that tracks to the target, as
                                indicated by the line. The broken crystals around the gun show that it is in crossbow
                                mode, and each piece is a physics object and can interact with the environment.
