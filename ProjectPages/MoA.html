                <p>A rogue-lite first-person looter shooter originally designed and developed as a team of 4-5
                    developers
                    for the Game Design and Development module and is now development is being continued by me as my
                    final
                    year project.

                </p>
                <p> The game is best described as an FPS game with movement and shooting mechanics inspired by other
                    fast
                    pace shooters like DOOM Eternal, Apex Legends and Destiny 2. Mashed with guns that are randomly
                    pieced
                    and generated similar to the Borderlands series. Sprinkled with some rogue-lite elements inspired by
                    Hades.

                    <p class="col-md-12 ">Development started in early January 2021 as a team of 4-5 developers.
                        The
                        initial concept of the
                        game is having a fps shooter where guns are randomly pieced together similar to borderlands. I
                        started prototyping getting the generation of the weapon to piece random parts of gun models
                        together to generate Frankenstein guns, where stats and handling of the weapons are based on the
                        pieced components.
                    </p>


                    <p class="col-md-12">
                        Soon my teammates managed to get the enemies and room generation to work and we piece all of
                        them
                        together and started testing all the major systems and design concepts. Through testing, we have
                        found major flaws to our design, ranging from the levels being way too small and cramped to
                        visually
                        the fantasy art style isn’t working with the game.

                        After more playtesting and tweaking, the team decided to perform major
                        overhauls to the game, especially the visuals and level design. I was in charge of the visuals,
                        creating new shaders, materials and texture for the game to tune it to be more sci-fi style, as
                        well as handling multiple new game systems like the gunplay, VFX, shop/ unlocks, tutorial level
                        and many more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We submitted our Version 1.0 build as our Game Design and Development Coursework and have
                        achieved a score of 87%.

                    <p>
                        The game was successful and everyone that tried the game enjoyed it, but we did cut off quite a
                        lot of systems and features like skill trees to make it in time.

                        With having spent so much effort on this project, I have decided to continue it as a solo
                        developer as my final year project, to improve the game and for it to be at a releasable state.
                        So far the focus of the improvements includes but is not limited to:

                                <h3>Player Kit Overhaul</h3>
                                <img src="../img/MoA/PlayerKit.gif">
                                <p>Essentially adding crouching and sliding, wall sticking and bouncing and player melee
                                    ability on top of its existing kit which only includes dashing and double jumping.
                                    The
                                    reason for this change is to give the player more control and freedom to their
                                    movements
                                    and combat ability. Another reason is that from past playtesting, players expressed
                                    a
                                    desire to instinctively melee when they are close to enemies.</p>

                                <h3>Weapon animation rework</h3>
                                <img src="../img/MoA/WeaponAnimation.gif">
                                <p>With guns and weapons to be the star of the game, the focus is to make the weapons
                                    feel
                                    more satisfying to shoot and handle. This includes adding in floating hands to show
                                    the
                                    player is holding and operating the gun and improving the reload animations for
                                    them.
                                    The reason it was not in the game originally, is because with weapons being randomly
                                    generated, the position of the hand differs for each weapon and there wasn’t enough
                                    time
                                    and resources to invest in a dynamic hand animation controller until now. There were
                                    also playtesters’ feedbacks mentioning it feels weird operating a floating gun with
                                    no
                                    hands.</p>

                                <h3>Weapon Perks</h3>
                                <img src="../img/MoA/WeaponPerk.gif">
                                <p>Over time, each unique gun slowly feels the same. Each gun may visually be unique,
                                    but
                                    they all just shoot and do damage, just at different speeds and recoil. Hence with
                                    the
                                    introduction of weapon perks, it can make the weapons feel more unique and greater
                                    difference between a common weapon with no perks and an exotic weapon with 3+ perks.
                                    This also gives the player more incentive to keep playing the game to reach the
                                    later
                                    levels to get more unique, powerful weapons and a chance to get the dopamine hit
                                    when
                                    they get the <b>GOD ROLL!</b></p>

                                <p><b>“To make things to shoot at more fun to shoot at”</b>is the goal. As for how to
                                    achieve this
                                    goal, the AI will need to be reactive to the player and be more strategical than
                                    just
                                    moving around the map randomly. For example, the AI will try and maintain a distance
                                    from the player, take cover and attack behind cover so they can be harder to be
                                    killed.
                                    Another goal for this overhaul is to refactor the old AI code from using nested if
                                    statements of “if the player is less than X units away, shoot gun. Else, move to
