                <p>A first-person puzzle adventure game with a sense of humour, developed by a team of 3 developers and
                    an
                    artist. Inspired by games like Henry Stickman, the game involves the player picking up items and
                    using
                    them in the environment to escape. There are 5 different endings in the game and more than 10 unique
                    deaths.

                </p>
                <p> This game was developed for Game Job Live’s Summer Parade Summer 2021 with the theme of “one time
                    use”
                    and a time limit of 1 week (plus one week of polishing). It was nominated and won the awards for
                    Best 3D
                    Art.

                <div class="row  container-fluid  ">
                    <p class="col-md-12">A large focus is put into the game’s philosophy of “each item can only be
                        used once”, “items must have at least 2 interactions” and “interactions must make some sense”.
                        With
                        those points, we design the interactions for each level with a specific workflow starting from:
                    </p>

                        <li>What possible items will the player have in their inventory at this point?
                        </li>
                        <li> What items (pickups and interactable) will be in this type of room?
                        </li>
                        <li>What is the flow of the solution to escape this room?
                        </li>
                        <li> What kind of interactions can they perform with ONLY the items in this room?
                        </li>
                        <li>What would those interactions lead to? (creation of a new item? Advancing to the next level?
                            Leading to a death scene?)
                        </li>
                        <li>Which sets of interactions would lead to escaping this room? (So that they won’t be soft
                            locked from missing items from past rooms)
                        </li>
                        <li>What items from pass rooms can be used for the current interactions we have?

                <div class="  container-fluid  ">
                    <h3>LIVING QUARTERS</h3>
                    <img src="../img/PoTeTows/LivingQuarters.jpg">
                    <p>This is the first room of the game, so our focus is to keep it simple and introduce the mechanics
                        of
                        picking up and using objects in the game, the narrative objective via some environmental
                        storytelling through the system board and the wackiness of the game, ranging from pulling a
                        lever
                        and getting ejected to turning an apple into an apple pie with the broken fuse box.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="  container-fluid  ">
                    <h3>LOCKER ROOM</h3>
                    <img src="../img/PoTeTows/LockerRoom.jpg">
                    <p>This room focus on introducing the player to more items and wackiness essentially. It also shows
                        the
                        player that the game will troll kill the player with the falling locker. This interaction also
                        introduces the concept of using heavy items to break glass, which will be important in the next
                        level. The level also has an easter egg to Star Wars’ trash compactor room.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="  container-fluid  ">
                    <h3>PLANT ROOM</h3>
                    <img src="../img/PoTeTows/PlantRoom.jpg">
                    <p>The focus of this room is to present an interaction/ solution to the player to avoid the toxic,
                        by
                        having a gas mask protected by a glass box with a crowbar beside it, just to trap and troll kill
                        the
                        player with the falling potato, a reference to Indiana Jones. The player can move away from the
                        potato while it falls to avoid death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another focus for this room is having TWO possible solutions instead of just one, giving the
                        player
                        more freedom and interactions based on what they wanted to do, and also what items they have
                        collected from past rooms. This room does break the philosophy of “each item can only be used
                        once”,
                        as the player can pick up the blowtorch and/ or fertiliser again after using it to burn or grow
                        the
                        plants.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Kitchen</h3>
                    <img src="../img/PoTeTows/Kitchen.jpg">
                    <p>Due to time constraints, this room changed from being the penultimate room to the final room with
                        5
                        possible endings. 4 out of 5 of the endings will require items from previous rooms and one of
                        the
                        endings will only require items from this room but it is the most boring and unsatisfying
                        ending.
                        This encourages the player to replay the game to try and find the other endings.

                    </div>
                    <p>The most common ending players will get when they play through it the first time. This ending is
                        a
                        massive reference to the Souls game and requires the player to destroy the oven and place the
                        knife
                        in the ashes to create a bonfire. The player can then take the sword to then “battle” with the
                        evil
                        robot boss. If the player interacts with the front of the boss, the boss will “parry” and
                        counter-attack. The player will need to walk behind the boss and backstab it.
                    </p>

                <div class="  container-fluid  ">
                    <h3>Ending 2: Put You Back Together</h3>
                    <div class=" embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 project-deep-dive-progress-iframe mx-auto">

                    </div>
                    <p>This is the more serious ending that has more behind the scenes narrative to it. Where the story
                        is
                        about crewmates being turned into food from past experiments, and your goal is to bury them or
                        give
                        them a new body. The ending requires the player to find the bury the body from the trash can and
                        also replace the robot head with the potato that was once a crewmate. The potato robot is a
                        reference to Portal 2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fun Fact: the player's body and head both use a potato model, which gives the head rolling to
                        have a
                        more unpredictable and satisfying movement.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="  container-fluid  ">

                    </div>
                    <p>This is a joke ending that requires the player to find all the food in the game, cook them, and
                        bring
                        them to the dining table. Narratively does not make sense considering the player was asked to
                        escape
                        the ship from a gas leak, but then decided to start for a grand tasty meal.

                        head. This is the “last resort” ending, where the player lacks any items from past rooms to
                        complete
                        any other endings.

                    <p>This is the secret final ending where the player requires the stick from the start of the game
                        and
                        “break” the final level by jumping out the window to then land on an invisible floor to then
                        interact with the chicken. This golden stick is a reference to South Park: The Stick of Truth,
                        while
                        the chicken is an inside joke where it is the first 3D model our team (PR0JEC7) used in our
                        first
                        project together.
