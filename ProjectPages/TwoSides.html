                <p>A decision-based life simulator story game developed by a team of 3 developers and an artist.
                    Inspired by
                    games like Reigns and Bitlife, where the player has 3 main stats Health, Bux and Mood, they would go
                    through different stages of life and be given different situations with 2 options which impacts the
                    3
                    stats. The goal is to survive as long as possible without any of the stats reaching 0. The player
                    can
                    also flip a coin instead and let the game randomly decide his fate.

                </div>
                <p> The game has multiple endings and has around 100+ unique cards and 15+ endings for the player to
                    discover. Based on the player’s actions throughout the game, they may gain or lose status effects
                    which
                    will determine what ending they get at the end.

                    This game was originally developed in 3 days for the BenBonk Jam #3 with the theme of “two sides”.
                    The
                    jam game ended up ranking 5th out of 133 entries and performed well so we decided to continue
                    development over the summer. We had plans to release this to be a paid game on steam but didn’t due
                    to
                    complications with starting a company and taxes. The full version is on itch.io for free now.

                    <p class="col-md-12">A devlog was made to capture and explained what happened during the development
                        of
                        the jam.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A key design decision that was missed out in the log was that the heads and tails buttons were
                        originally testing tools and planned to have limited uses during gameplay. Though, throughout
                        development and playtesting, we decided to change the coin flip from being the main mechanic to
                        an
                        optional mechanic and the buttons to be the main option for the player to interact with. The
                        reason
                        for
                        that was that the coin flips were too inconsistent, random and lacked control by the player
                        which
                        may
                        lead to unsatisfying game overs. Comparision to being given the choice to pick, it retains the
                        control
                        of the player to which decision they decided, but with the results being hidden, the player will
                        have to
                        deduce how would each option affects them. The change to the coin being optional also spices the
                        gameplay up, as this allows the player to essentially let the game decide if they don’t feel
                        like
                        deducing and more often be surprised by the outcome.

                <div class="  container-fluid  ">
                    <p>With the results of the jam being that well, we decided to continue development for the next 2
                        months. We added better card creation and editing by keeping the card data in a CSV format and
                        turning that into game data. Added features like achievements and endings tracking, status
                        effect
                        providing passive buffs and debuffs to stats. We also increase the number of cards and possible
                        endings drastically and also introduce little story sequences now and then during gameplay.
